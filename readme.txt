Introduction

Utilities like Telnet and remote control programs like Symantec's PC Anywhere
let you execute programs on remote systems, but they can be a pain to set up and
require that you install client software on the remote systems that you wish to
access. PsExec is a light-weight telnet-replacement that lets you execute
processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for console
applications, without having to manually install client software. PsExec's most 
powerful uses include launching interactive command-prompts on remote systems
and remote-enabling tools like IpConfig that otherwise do not have the ability
to show information about remote systems.
